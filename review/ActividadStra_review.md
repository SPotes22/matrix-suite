# Code Review for ActividadStra.py

```python
from StarClasic import strassen_secuencial
from StraHIlos import strassen_paralelo
import numpy as np

if __name__ == "__main__":
    size = 128  # Cambia a 125, 512, 1024 
    A = np.random.randint(0, 10, (size, size))
    B = np.random.randint(0, 10, (size, size))

    C_seq = strassen_secuencial(A, B)
    C_par = strassen_paralelo(A, B)

    print("多Son iguales las matrices resultantes?:", np.allclose(C_seq, C_par))
```

**Explanation:**

This code compares a sequential and a parallel implementation of the Strassen matrix multiplication algorithm.  Here's a breakdown:

1. **Imports:**
   - `from StarClasic import strassen_secuencial`: Imports the `strassen_secuencial` function from a module named `StarClasic`.  This function likely implements the Strassen algorithm in a sequential (non-parallel) manner.
   - `from StraHIlos import strassen_paralelo`: Imports the `strassen_paralelo` function from a module named `StraHIlos`. This function presumably implements the Strassen algorithm in a parallel fashion, likely using threads or processes.
   - `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library, which is essential for numerical operations, especially working with arrays (matrices).

2. **Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**
   - This ensures that the code within this block only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).

3. **Initialization:**
   - `size = 128`: Sets the size (number of rows and columns) of the matrices to 128. The comment suggests that you can change this value to 125, 512, or 1024 to test with different matrix sizes.
   - `A = np.random.randint(0, 10, (size, size))`: Creates a NumPy array named `A` of shape (size, size) (i.e., a `size` x `size` matrix). The elements of the matrix are random integers between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).
   - `B = np.random.randint(0, 10, (size, size))`:  Creates another NumPy array named `B` of the same shape as `A`, also filled with random integers between 0 and 10.

4. **Matrix Multiplication:**
   - `C_seq = strassen_secuencial(A, B)`: Calls the `strassen_secuencial` function to multiply matrices `A` and `B` using the sequential Strassen algorithm. The result (the product matrix) is stored in `C_seq`.
   - `C_par = strassen_paralelo(A, B)`: Calls the `strassen_paralelo` function to multiply matrices `A` and `B` using the parallel Strassen algorithm. The result is stored in `C_par`.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - `print("多Son iguales las matrices resultantes?:", np.allclose(C_seq, C_par))`:  This line does the following:
     - `np.allclose(C_seq, C_par)`:  Uses the `np.allclose()` function from NumPy to compare the two matrices `C_seq` and `C_par`. `np.allclose()` checks if two arrays are element-wise equal *within a certain tolerance*. This is important because floating-point calculations (which are often involved in matrix multiplication) can introduce small numerical errors, so a direct equality check (`==`) might fail even if the matrices are theoretically the same. `np.allclose()` considers two numbers to be "close" if their absolute difference is less than a relative tolerance multiplied by the larger of the two numbers, or if their absolute difference is less than an absolute tolerance. The default tolerances are usually suitable for most cases.
     - `print(...)`: Prints a message to the console, indicating whether the two resulting matrices (from the sequential and parallel algorithms) are considered equal (within the tolerance). The output will be either:
       - `"多Son iguales las matrices resultantes?: True"`  if the matrices are close enough.
       - `"多Son iguales las matrices resultantes?: False"` if the matrices differ significantly.

**In summary, the code:**

1. Sets up two random matrices A and B.
2. Multiplies them using both a sequential and a parallel version of the Strassen algorithm.
3. Compares the resulting matrices using `np.allclose()` to check for near-equality, accounting for potential floating-point errors.
4. Prints whether the results from the two implementations are considered equal.

The primary goal is likely to verify that the parallel implementation of the Strassen algorithm produces the same result as the sequential implementation, and potentially to compare their performance (although the performance comparison part is not present in the provided code).
