# Code Review for utils.py

This code provides functions for padding and unpadding a square matrix to the nearest power of two size. This is often useful in algorithms like the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or other divide-and-conquer algorithms that perform efficiently on sizes that are powers of two.  Let's break down each function:

**1. `next_power_of_two(n)`:**

*   **Purpose:** This function calculates the smallest power of two that is greater than or equal to the input integer `n`.  It's used to determine the new size to pad the matrix to.

*   **Implementation:**
    *   `return 1 if n == 0 else 2**(n - 1).bit_length()`
        *   Handles the edge case where `n` is 0. In this case, it returns 1 (2<sup>0</sup>).
        *   Otherwise, it calculates `(n - 1).bit_length()`. The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.  Crucially, this is equal to  floor(log2(n-1)) + 1.
        *   It then calculates `2**(n - 1).bit_length()`.  Since `(n-1).bit_length()` is approximately log2(n-1)+1 , then 2**((n-1).bit_length()) is approximately 2**(log2(n-1) +1) which simplifies to 2 * (n-1).
        *   **Example:**
            *   If `n` is 5:
                *   `n - 1` is 4.
                *   `4.bit_length()` is 3 (because 4 is 100 in binary, requiring 3 bits).
                *   `2**3` is 8.  This is the smallest power of two greater than or equal to 5.
            *   If `n` is 8:
                *   `n - 1` is 7.
                *   `7.bit_length()` is 3 (because 7 is 111 in binary, requiring 3 bits).
                *   `2**3` is 8.  This is the smallest power of two greater than or equal to 8.
        *   The algorithm works even if n is a power of two because, for example, if `n` is 8, then it calculates the next power of two to be 8.

**2. `pad_matrix(A, size)`:**

*   **Purpose:**  Takes a square matrix `A` (represented as a NumPy array) and pads it with zeros to create a new square matrix whose dimensions are the next power of two greater than or equal to `size`.

*   **Implementation:**
    *   `new_size = next_power_of_two(size)`:  Calculates the size of the padded matrix using the `next_power_of_two` function.
    *   `padded = np.zeros((new_size, new_size), dtype=A.dtype)`: Creates a new NumPy array filled with zeros, with dimensions `(new_size, new_size)`. The `dtype` argument ensures that the padded matrix has the same data type as the original matrix `A`.
    *   `padded[:size, :size] = A`: Copies the elements of the original matrix `A` into the upper-left corner of the padded matrix.  `[:size, :size]` is NumPy's slicing notation for selecting rows and columns from 0 up to (but not including) `size`.
    *   `return padded`: Returns the padded matrix.

**3. `unpad_matrix(C, size)`:**

*   **Purpose:**  Takes a padded square matrix `C` and removes the padding, returning the original square matrix (or at least, the part that was not padding).

*   **Implementation:**
    *   `return C[:size, :size]`:  Uses NumPy slicing to extract the upper-left `size x size` portion of the padded matrix `C`.  This effectively removes the padding.

**In Summary:**

This code provides a convenient way to:

1.  Determine the next power of two greater than or equal to a given size.
2.  Pad a square matrix with zeros to increase its dimensions to the nearest power of two.
3.  Remove the zero padding from a padded matrix to get the original matrix back.

These functions are frequently used in scenarios where algorithms perform best when operating on data with power-of-two sizes. For example, in FFT implementations, padding input data to a power-of-two size significantly optimizes the computation.
