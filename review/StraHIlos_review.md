# Code Review for StraHIlos.py

The code implements the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, with parallelization using Python's `threading` module.  Let's break it down step by step:

**1. Strassen Algorithm Overview**

The Strassen algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for matrix multiplication that is asymptotically faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm (which has a time complexity of O(n^3)).  It reduces the number of multiplications needed, which is the dominant cost in standard matrix multiplication.  The key idea is to recursively divide the matrices into submatrices and then perform a series of additions and subtractions to calculate seven intermediate matrices (M1 to M7). These intermediate matrices are then combined to form the final product.

**2. Code Breakdown**

* **`import threading`**: Imports the `threading` module, which is used for creating and managing threads for parallel execution.
* **`import numpy as np`**: Imports the `numpy` library, which is essential for efficient numerical operations, especially matrix operations.
* **`def strassen_paralelo(A, B)`**: Defines the main function that performs Strassen matrix multiplication.  It takes two NumPy arrays `A` and `B` as input.

* **`n = A.shape[0]`**:  Gets the dimension of the matrices (assuming they are square matrices).  `A.shape[0]` gives the number of rows in matrix `A`.

* **`if n == 1:`**:  This is the base case for the recursion.  When the matrices are 1x1, it simply multiplies the two single elements and returns the result.  This stops the recursive calls.

* **`mid = n // 2`**: Calculates the midpoint for dividing the matrices into submatrices.  `//` is integer division.

* **Submatrix Creation:**

   ```python
   A11, A12 = A[:mid, :mid], A[:mid, mid:]
   A21, A22 = A[mid:, :mid], A[mid:, mid:]
   B11, B12 = B[:mid, :mid], B[:mid, mid:]
   B21, B22 = B[mid:, :mid], B[mid:, mid:]
   ```

   This part divides the matrices `A` and `B` into four submatrices of size `n/2 x n/2`:  `A11`, `A12`, `A21`, `A22`, `B11`, `B12`, `B21`, `B22`.  NumPy's slicing is used for this division. For example, `A[:mid, :mid]` selects the rows from the beginning up to `mid` and the columns from the beginning up to `mid`.

* **Parallel Calculation Setup:**

   ```python
   results = [None] * 7
   def thread_fn(i, func, *args):
       results[i] = func(*args)

   threads = [
       threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(0, strassen_paralelo, A11 + A22, B11 + B22)),
       threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(1, strassen_paralelo, A21 + A22, B11)),
       threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(2, strassen_paralelo, A11, B12 - B22)),
       threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(3, strassen_paralelo, A22, B21 - B11)),
       threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(4, strassen_paralelo, A11 + A12, B22)),
       threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(5, strassen_paralelo, A21 - A11, B11 + B12)),
       threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(6, strassen_paralelo, A12 - A22, B21 + B22)),
   ]
   ```

   * `results = [None] * 7`:  Creates a list to store the results of the seven recursive calls to `strassen_paralelo` (M1 to M7).  It's initialized with `None` values.
   * `def thread_fn(i, func, *args):`: Defines a helper function `thread_fn` that will be executed by each thread.  It takes an index `i`, a function `func` (which will be `strassen_paralelo` in this case), and variable arguments `*args`. The helper function calculates the result using the supplied function and arguments, and stores the result in the `results` list at the index `i`.
   * `threads = [...]`: Creates a list of seven `threading.Thread` objects. Each thread is configured to execute the `thread_fn` function with specific arguments.  Each thread computes one of the seven intermediate matrices (M1 to M7) according to the Strassen algorithm. For example:
      * `threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(0, strassen_paralelo, A11 + A22, B11 + B22))` creates a thread that calculates `M1 = (A11 + A22) * (B11 + B22)`.  The `target` specifies the function to run in the thread, and `args` provides the arguments to that function. The first argument to the helper function `thread_fn` is the index `i = 0` which means the result of the matrix multiplication will be stored in `results[0]`.

* **Thread Management:**

   ```python
   for t in threads:
       t.start()
   for t in threads:
       t.join()
   ```

   * `for t in threads: t.start()`: Starts each of the threads, allowing them to run concurrently (or as concurrently as Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows).
   * `for t in threads: t.join()`:  Waits for each thread to finish its execution before proceeding.  `t.join()` blocks the main thread until the thread `t` completes. This ensures that all seven intermediate matrices (M1 to M7) are calculated before the next step.

* **Retrieving Results:**

   ```python
   M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7 = results
   ```

   Unpacks the results from the `results` list into individual variables `M1` through `M7`.  These variables now hold the calculated intermediate matrices.

* **Combining Intermediate Results:**

   ```python
   C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7
   C12 = M3 + M5
   C21 = M2 + M4
   C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6
   ```

   This part calculates the four submatrices of the resulting matrix `C` using the intermediate matrices `M1` through `M7` according to the Strassen algorithm formulas.

* **Reconstructing the Result Matrix:**

   ```python
   top = np.hstack((C11, C12))
   bottom = np.hstack((C21, C22))
   return np.vstack((top, bottom))
   ```

   * `np.hstack((C11, C12))`: Horizontally stacks the submatrices `C11` and `C12` to create the top half of the result matrix.  `np.hstack` joins arrays along columns.
   * `np.hstack((C21, C22))`: Horizontally stacks the submatrices `C21` and `C22` to create the bottom half of the result matrix.
   * `np.vstack((top, bottom))`: Vertically stacks the `top` and `bottom` halves to form the complete result matrix `C`. `np.vstack` joins arrays along rows.
   * `return np.vstack((top, bottom))`: Returns the final result matrix.

**In Summary**

The code implements the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication using recursion and parallelization.  It divides the matrices into submatrices, calculates seven intermediate matrices in parallel using threads, and then combines these intermediate results to form the final product matrix.  The use of threading aims to speed up the computation by performing some of the calculations concurrently.  However, due to Python's GIL, the actual speedup might be limited, especially for CPU-bound tasks.  For true parallelism with NumPy, consider using libraries like `dask` or `joblib`. Also, for smaller matrices, the overhead of creating and managing threads might outweigh the benefits of parallelization.
