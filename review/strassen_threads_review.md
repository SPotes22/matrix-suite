# Code Review for strassen_threads.py

The code implements the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, with parallel execution of the recursive calls. Let's break down the code step-by-step:

**1. Imports:**

*   `import numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library for numerical operations, especially for working with arrays (matrices). It's aliased as `np` for easier use.
*   `import threading`: Imports the `threading` module, which provides support for creating and managing threads, enabling parallel execution.

**2. `strassen_paralelo(A, B)` Function:**

This function takes two NumPy arrays (matrices) `A` and `B` as input and returns their product using the Strassen algorithm.

*   **Base Case:**
    ```python
    n = A.shape[0]
    if n == 1:
        return A * B
    ```
    This checks if the matrices are of size 1x1. If so, it performs simple element-wise multiplication and returns the result. This is the base case for the recursion. This is necessary as strassen's algorithm only helps with larger sizes.

*   **Divide:**
    ```python
    mid = n // 2
    A11, A12 = A[:mid, :mid], A[:mid, mid:]
    A21, A22 = A[mid:, :mid], A[mid:, mid:]
    B11, B12 = B[:mid, :mid], B[:mid, mid:]
    B21, B22 = B[mid:, :mid], B[mid:, mid:]
    ```
    This part divides the input matrices `A` and `B` into four sub-matrices of equal size (n/2 x n/2). If `n` is not a power of 2, the algorithm will still work but the division might not be perfectly equal. This extracts submatrices: A11, A12, A21, A22, B11, B12, B21, and B22.

*   **Parallel Computation of Strassen Products (M1 to M7):**
    ```python
    results = [None] * 7
    def thread_fn(i, func, *args):
        results[i] = func(*args)

    threads = [
        threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(0, strassen_paralelo, A11 + A22, B11 + B22)),
        threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(1, strassen_paralelo, A21 + A22, B11)),
        threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(2, strassen_paralelo, A11, B12 - B22)),
        threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(3, strassen_paralelo, A22, B21 - B11)),
        threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(4, strassen_paralelo, A11 + A12, B22)),
        threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(5, strassen_paralelo, A21 - A11, B11 + B12)),
        threading.Thread(target=thread_fn, args=(6, strassen_paralelo, A12 - A22, B21 + B22)),
    ]

    for t in threads:
        t.start()
    for t in threads:
        t.join()

    M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7 = results
    ```
    This is the core of the Strassen algorithm, where the 7 intermediate products (M1 to M7) are calculated recursively. The important part here is the use of the `threading` module to parallelize these calculations.

    *   `results = [None] * 7`:  Initializes a list to store the results of the 7 recursive calls.
    *   `thread_fn(i, func, *args)`: This function is the target for each thread. It calls the `func` (in this case, `strassen_paralelo`) with the given `args` and stores the result in the `results` list at index `i`. This avoids race conditions on a shared variable.
    *   `threads = [...]`:  Creates a list of `threading.Thread` objects. Each thread is responsible for computing one of the intermediate products (M1 to M7). The `target` is set to `thread_fn`, which will execute `strassen_paralelo` recursively.  The `args` are passed to `thread_fn` and include the index (0-6), the function to execute (strassen_paralelo), and the sub-matrices to be multiplied.  The additions and subtractions of the submatrices are part of the Strassen algorithm.
    *   `for t in threads: t.start()`:  Starts all the threads, allowing them to run concurrently.
    *   `for t in threads: t.join()`:  Waits for all threads to complete their execution before proceeding.  `t.join()` blocks until the thread `t` has finished. This ensures that all the intermediate products (M1 to M7) are calculated before they are used in the next step.
    *   `M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7 = results`: Assigns the results from the `results` list to the variables M1 to M7.

*   **Combine:**
    ```python
    C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7
    C12 = M3 + M5
    C21 = M2 + M4
    C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6

    top = np.hstack((C11, C12))
    bottom = np.hstack((C21, C22))
    return np.vstack((top, bottom))
    ```
    This part combines the intermediate products (M1 to M7) to form the four sub-matrices (C11, C12, C21, C22) of the resulting matrix `C`. The formulas used here are a core part of the Strassen algorithm. Finally, the submatrices are combined horizontally using `np.hstack` to form `top` and `bottom` rows. Then, the `top` and `bottom` rows are combined vertically using `np.vstack` to create the final result matrix, which is then returned.

**In summary:**

The code implements the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that reduces the number of multiplications required compared to the standard matrix multiplication algorithm (from 8 to 7 multiplications).  Critically, this implementation uses the `threading` module to perform the recursive calls in parallel, which can significantly improve performance, especially for large matrices, on multi-core processors.  The key steps are:

1.  **Base Case:** If the matrix is small (1x1), perform regular multiplication.
2.  **Divide:** Divide the input matrices into four sub-matrices of equal size.
3.  **Parallel Computation:** Recursively compute 7 intermediate products (M1 to M7) using the Strassen formulas, each in a separate thread.
4.  **Combine:** Combine the intermediate products to form the sub-matrices of the resulting matrix.
5.  **Return:** Combine the sub-matrices to create the final result matrix.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Overhead of Threading:**  Creating and managing threads has overhead. For very small matrices, the overhead of threading might outweigh the benefits of parallelization, making the standard matrix multiplication algorithm faster.
*   **Matrix Size:** Strassen's algorithm is generally more efficient for larger matrices. The threshold size depends on the specific implementation and hardware.
*   **Memory Usage:** Strassen's algorithm requires more memory compared to the standard algorithm due to the creation of intermediate matrices.
*   **Square Matrices:** This code assumes that the input matrices `A` and `B` are square and have compatible dimensions for multiplication (A's number of columns equals B's number of rows). Also it works best when n is a power of 2, but will still function otherwise.

This implementation provides a way to speed up matrix multiplication using the Strassen algorithm and parallel processing.  However, it's crucial to consider the overhead and memory implications to determine if it's the most suitable approach for a given use case.
