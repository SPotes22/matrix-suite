# Code Review for strassen_seq.py

This code implements Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication, specifically a sequential (non-parallel) version.  Here's a breakdown:

**1. `strassen_secuencial(A, B)`:**

   - **Purpose:** This function recursively multiplies two square matrices `A` and `B` using Strassen's algorithm.

   - **Input:**
     - `A`: A NumPy array representing the first square matrix.
     - `B`: A NumPy array representing the second square matrix.

   - **Output:**
     - A NumPy array representing the product of `A` and `B` (i.e., `A * B`).

**2. Base Case: `if n == 1:`**

   - `n = A.shape[0]` gets the dimension of the (assumed to be square) matrix `A`.
   - If the matrix size is 1x1 (a single element), it simply multiplies the two elements and returns the result.  This is the stopping condition for the recursion.  This is crucial because Strassen's algorithm is about breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, until the subproblems are trivial to solve.

**3. Divide: Matrix Partitioning**

   - `mid = n // 2` calculates the middle index to split the matrices.
   - The code then splits both matrices `A` and `B` into four sub-matrices, each of size `n/2 x n/2`:
     - `A11`: Top-left quadrant of `A`
     - `A12`: Top-right quadrant of `A`
     - `A21`: Bottom-left quadrant of `A`
     - `A22`: Bottom-right quadrant of `A`
     - `B11`, `B12`, `B21`, `B22`: Corresponding quadrants of `B`.

   - `A[:mid, :mid]` creates a view of the A matrix, containing the first `mid` rows and first `mid` columns. This corresponds to A11. `A[:mid, mid:]` represents the first `mid` rows, but from column index `mid` onwards. This is A12.  The same logic applies to all other quadrants.  Important:  These are *views* of the original matrix; they don't copy the data unless modified.

**4. Conquer: Calculate the Seven Products (M1 to M7)**

   - This is the heart of Strassen's algorithm.  Instead of the usual eight multiplications required for a naive matrix multiplication, Strassen's algorithm cleverly combines sums and differences of the sub-matrices to require only seven multiplications.
   - The code recursively calls `strassen_secuencial` to compute seven intermediate products (M1 through M7):

     - `M1 = strassen_secuencial(A11 + A22, B11 + B22)`
     - `M2 = strassen_secuencial(A21 + A22, B11)`
     - `M3 = strassen_secuencial(A11, B12 - B22)`
     - `M4 = strassen_secuencial(A22, B21 - B11)`
     - `M5 = strassen_secuencial(A11 + A12, B22)`
     - `M6 = strassen_secuencial(A21 - A11, B11 + B12)`
     - `M7 = strassen_secuencial(A12 - A22, B21 + B22)`

**5. Combine: Calculate the Four Result Sub-matrices (C11, C12, C21, C22)**

   - Using the seven intermediate products (M1 to M7), the code calculates the four quadrants of the result matrix `C` (where `C = A * B`):

     - `C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7`
     - `C12 = M3 + M5`
     - `C21 = M2 + M4`
     - `C22 = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6`

**6. Reconstruct the Result Matrix**

   - `top = np.hstack((C11, C12))` horizontally stacks `C11` and `C12` to create the top half of the result matrix.
   - `bottom = np.hstack((C21, C22))` horizontally stacks `C21` and `C22` to create the bottom half of the result matrix.
   - `return np.vstack((top, bottom))` vertically stacks the `top` and `bottom` halves to form the complete result matrix `C` and returns it.

**In Summary:**

The code implements Strassen's algorithm, a divide-and-conquer approach, to multiply two square matrices.  It recursively splits the matrices into sub-matrices, calculates seven intermediate products, and then combines these products to form the final result.  Strassen's algorithm has a time complexity of approximately O(n<sup>log<sub>2</sub>7</sup>), which is asymptotically faster than the naive matrix multiplication algorithm (O(n<sup>3</sup>)) for large matrices. However, the overhead of recursion and the extra additions/subtractions can make it slower for small matrices.

**Important Notes:**

* **Square Matrices:** Strassen's algorithm, in this implementation, works best with square matrices where the dimension is a power of 2.  For other matrix sizes, you might need to pad the matrices with zeros to make them square and of a power-of-2 size.  Padding and un-padding can add complexity.
* **Recursion Overhead:** The recursive calls can introduce significant overhead, especially for small matrix sizes.  There's a "crossover point" where Strassen's algorithm becomes faster than the naive algorithm.
* **Numerical Stability:** Strassen's algorithm can be less numerically stable than the naive algorithm in some cases, due to the subtractions involved.
* **Memory Usage:** Strassen's algorithm generally has a higher memory footprint due to the creation of temporary sub-matrices during the recursive calls.
* **Sequential Implementation:** This is a sequential implementation. Parallel versions of Strassen's algorithm can further improve performance by executing the sub-matrix multiplications concurrently.
